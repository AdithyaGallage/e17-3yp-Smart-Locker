> ## Overview

The Smart Locker is a improvement for the traditional locker where we are trying to provide the lockers for public usage.
Normal traditional lockers were used privately but as a team we think if lockers can be provided in a public way where citizens will 
book lockers for their acess in public places it would be a market opportunity.

We are as a team will develop a locker with digital improvements where users can unlock the locker by purchasing it online for a certain time period.
The Lock itself will be developed by a arduino based electronic system where set of lockers will be monitered by a centeralized system.
